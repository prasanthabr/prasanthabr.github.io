Trust is build very slowly and lost very quickly.  
Yet trust is key to effective consulting; a consultant needs to be trusted if
the consultant is to be effective.  

Trust with a customer can be built with Credibility, Reliability and Connection.  

Consultants should work to improve these levers to become more trusted and
thereby more effective.
