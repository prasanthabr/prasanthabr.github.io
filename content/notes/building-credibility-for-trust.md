What behaviours promote credibility with the client.  

- Being open about what you do not know.  
    - The thinking being ai is moving so fast that we can't know all.
    - This is a risky move; client perceptions are easy to set.  
    - Most effective if used once a fair bit of connection has been established.  
- Calling Risks early  
    - This gives the impression that the consultant has encountered this before.  
    - Gives the impression of being a trusted collaborator, if used well.
